                According to an Elsevier report, only about 1% of the
                world&apos;s research is by Africans Scholars in Africa. This is
                not because Africans are not talented enough, they are not given
                enough support or resources to conduct a research. instead, the
                outsiders (especially Europeans and North Americans) have been
                keen on stealing data from Africa to publish papers for their
                own promotion

                . One of the aims of this Charity is to inspired Africans in
                Africa to work on problems important to their countries. I am
                currently working 24/7 with researchers in about 20 African
                Countries, the attached give a list of publications broken down
                by the country of residence of the researchers.
